# Journally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Goals

### Immediate Goals

- [X] Implement Journal Entry selection, content in writing pad
    - [ ] Implement fancier editor
- [ ] *Calendar* view: able to see streaks and activities

### Long-term Idea List

- [ ] User sign-in, cloud storage
    - [ ] Streak count
- [ ] Rich text *formatting*: cf. Dayone
- [ ] Word count
- [ ] AI powered prompts (reminders) (cf other diary products)
- [ ] AI summary feature for time
- [ ] Sortable and searchable *tags* (Apple Journal’s limitations)
- [ ] *Search* by date, day, time…
- [X] Multiple journals (like Dayone Premium)
- [ ] *Graphs* of (customizable) stats over time (e.g. weight, study time, etc)


## Issues

- [ ] Undefined behavior after deleting all journals (selectJournal state must not be null)
